# CampusCoffee (WS 25/26)

## Prerequisites

* Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or a compatible open-source alternative such as [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/).
* Install the [Temurin JDK 21](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=21&os=any&arch=any) and [Maven 3.9](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) either via the provided [`mise.toml`](mise.toml) file (see [getting started guide](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) for details) or directly via your favorite package manager.
* Install a Java IDE. We recommend [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), but you are free to use alternatives such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with suitable extensions.

## Build application

First, make sure that the Docker daemon is running.
Then, to build the application, run the following command in the command line (or use the Maven integration of your IDE):

```shell
mvn clean install
```
**Note:** In the `dev` profile, all repositories are cleared before startup, the initial data is loaded (see [`LoadInitialData.java`](application/src/main/java/de/seuhd/campuscoffee/LoadInitialData.java)).

You can use the quiet mode to suppress most log messages:

```shell
mvn clean install -q
```

## Start application (dev)

First, make sure that the Docker daemon is running.
Before you start the application, you first need to start a Postgres docker container:

```shell
docker run -d -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 postgres:17-alpine
```

Then, you can start the application:

```shell
cd application
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```
**Note:** The data source is configured via the [`application.yaml`](application/src/main/resources/application.yaml) file.

## REST API

You can use `curl` in the command line to send HTTP requests to the REST API.

### POS endpoint

#### Get POS

All POS:
```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/api/pos
```
POS by ID:
```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/api/pos/1 # add valid POS id here
```

#### Create POS

Create a POS based on a JSON object provided in the request body:

```shell
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"name":"New Café","description":"Description","type":"CAFE","campus":"ALTSTADT","street":"Hauptstraße","houseNumber":"100","postalCode":69117,"city":"Heidelberg"}' http://localhost:8080/api/pos
```

#### Import POS from OpenStreetMap

Create a POS based on an OpenStreetMap node:

```shell
curl --request POST http://localhost:8080/api/pos/import/osm/5589879349
```

- Success (201 Created): Location header points to `/api/pos/{id}` and JSON representation is returned
- Not found (404): if the OSM node does not exist
- Bad request (400): if the OSM node misses required fields (e.g., name, address)
- Bad gateway (502): if the external OSM service fails or returns invalid XML
- Conflict (409): if a POS with the same name already exists (general uniqueness rule)

Idempotency:
- If a POS was already imported from the same `osmNodeId`, the endpoint returns 201 with the existing POS (same representation). The `osmNodeId` is stored internally to avoid duplicate imports.

Example success response (truncated):

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Rada Coffee & Rösterei",
  "description": "Imported from OSM node 5589879349",
  "type": "CAFE",
  "campus": "ALTSTADT",
  "street": "Untere Straße",
  "houseNumber": "21",
  "postalCode": 69117,
  "city": "Heidelberg"
}
```

#### Update POS

Update title and description:
```shell
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request PUT --data '{"id":4,"name":"New coffee","description":"Great croissants","type":"CAFE","campus":"ALTSTADT","street":"Hauptstraße","houseNumber":"95","postalCode":69117,"city":"Heidelberg"}' http://localhost:8080/api/pos/4 # set correct POS id here and in the body
```
